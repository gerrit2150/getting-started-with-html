<h1>learnings from lesson one</h1>
<b>simple explanation of how the web works</b>
<P> the internet is a number of computers (<b>servers</b>) 
linked with each other. <b>http</b> is the technology protocoll 
on which computers link and communicate. <br> through my browser i send 
a http-request to a server. the server sends an <b>html</b> file. 
Html is a language my browser can interprete and visualize to me.<br> 
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> 
does likely a better job at explaining.</a></P>
<b>computers are stupid</b>
<P>...the experts say. what they mean is if I I type 
<em> enusre hte enxt wrod is bodl</em>, a human understands this instruction -
a computer does not.<br> that is why languages like <b>html</b> exist.
It stands for <em>hypertext markup language</em>.
It uses e.g. defined elements, containing tags and content as well as 
attributes and their values. Using that language (without mistakes) allows you to control 
what one sees (<em>text</em>)and how one sees that (<em>markup</em>). </P>
<b>as a beginner...</b>
<p>... I should remember that there are too many facts in programming 
and I should take away the bigger things like above.
If needed I can <a href="www.google.com">google</a> the details - or call Andy.</p>
